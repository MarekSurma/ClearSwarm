Creates a directory and its immediate contents (files and subdirectories at one level). For subdirectories with nested content, delegates to other dir_creator instances. This enables parallel hierarchical directory structure creation.

Parameters expected in message:
- base_path: Path where to create the directory structure
- structure: JSON object defining what to create at this level
